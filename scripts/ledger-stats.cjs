/**
 * ledger-stats — read `.claude/agent-loop/ledger.jsonl` and report whether the
 * charters are actually working.
 *
 * The report file is emptied at every wrap, so it cannot answer "has this lane
 * ever pushed back?". The ledger can: it is append-only, one line per dispatch.
 * This script is its reader.
 *
 * What it measures, and why the ratio is the point rather than the count:
 *   • A lane that returns `built` for everything is not obeying a charter, it is
 *     just building. Charters exist to produce refusals — `blocked-charter`,
 *     `needs-owner-decision`, `needs-dependency`. A pushback rate of ZERO is the
 *     signal, not a clean bill of health.
 *   • A CLIMBING `blocked-charter` rate is a lane telling you a rule has gone
 *     wrong. That is an M6 architectural signal, not a lane misbehaving.
 *   • `needs-dependency` is the seam map: which lanes keep reaching across tells
 *     you where the ownership boundary is drawn in the wrong place.
 *
 * Read-only. Never writes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/ledger-stats.cjs --open          # THE OPEN BACKLOG — start here
 *   node scripts/ledger-stats.cjs                 # per-lane pushback ratios
 *   node scripts/ledger-stats.cjs --since 2026-07-01
 *   node scripts/ledger-stats.cjs --lane meeting  # one lane, with its findings
 *   node scripts/ledger-stats.cjs --runs          # per-run summary
 *
 * `--open` exists because the backlog IS the ledger — every row whose verdict is
 * not `built` is still open, so a separate backlog file is a second copy that
 * drifts. Owner's call, 2026-07-26: "audit backlog is the ledger, so you should
 * update there."
